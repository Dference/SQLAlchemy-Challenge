# SQLAlchemy-Challenge
## Surfs Up Dude!

I've decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with my trip planning, I decide to do a climate analysis about the area. I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of my climate database.  I got the previous 12 months of precipitation data by querying, as well as the total number of stations in the dataset and the lowest, highest, and average temperatures of the most-active station, to see how the data was structured by regions. Now the work is done, time for some sun, kowbunga dude.
